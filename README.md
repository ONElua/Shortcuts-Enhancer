With this app, you can create custom images linked to any PS Vita app/game for the shortcuts shown in the PS Vita index menu, also, you can select between the icon or the startup image of your app/game to create the shrotcut preview.

When creating the preview images, you can choose between a bunch of colorfull backgrounds (when icon0 is selected, thanks to moody b) to make your shortcuts look the way you want them.

Just in case you want to create your own images with PS or any other image editor, all you have to do is resize them to 282*108, rename them to the game id in upper case letters,save them as png format and place them in the following path<br>
*ux0:data/SHORTCUTS/1MENUVITA.PNG*  (as an example XD)

Also, if you want to use your own font for the previews you can place your font file at<br>
*ux0:data/SHORTCUTS/font/*
